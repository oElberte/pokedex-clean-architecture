# Pokédex (Clean Architecture)

I don't really like Pokémon at all but I really like the Pokédex idea, so I want to made an app with Flutter (in a sea of Pokédex apps).

This is the major update in my Pokédex app, now using Clean Architecture and TDD principles to get a better code.

I'm doing the app mostly with native code, avoiding libraries. As development progresses and I see the need to use libraries, I will.
